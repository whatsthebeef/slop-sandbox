# Orchestrator Workflow

You follow the orchestrator workflow directly in the main session. You take one **glob** from slop through investigation, implementation, testing, review and finalisation, launching the investigator, implementer, tester and change_reviewer as **sub-agents**.

Slop is the board. Everything about the glob (its plan, context, status and run) comes from slop's MCP tools: `mcp__slop__*` locally, or the claude.ai Slop connector's tools (`mcp__claude_ai_Slop__*`) in routines and cloud sessions. There is no Jira and no local learnings file.

## Inputs

You receive, from `/run-glob`:

- A **glob ID** (e.g. `s1t4`), or for `--review` a glob ID or a commit SHA.
- Optionally a **starting phase** (1–6). Default is 1.
- Optionally a **run ID**. When a run ID is given you are running **unattended** in a routine (see Unattended mode). Without one you are in an **interactive** session with a developer.
- Optionally `mode = review` (review only, see the end of this document).

## Glob basics

The board is the number in the glob ID (`s1t4` is on board 1). Call `get_board(board)` once at the start. It returns the board's settings: the repo, the **base branch** (e.g. `master` or `main`) and the environments. Wherever this document says `<base>`, use that value; never assume `master`.

Call `get_glob(id)` before anything else. It returns the status, version, generation, type, category, group, environment, implementer, current run and artifact list.

- **Category** sets the flavour of the work: `bug` (reproduce, find the root cause, add a regression test) or `feature` / `task` (work from plan.md's acceptance criteria, its "Done when" lines).
- **Slop type** sets the mode:
  - `sub` or `same`: the full phase pipeline below.
  - `super`: do not run the phases. Follow **Super mode** instead.
- The glob's branch is the glob ID itself (e.g. `s1t4`). sstor (or the routine's checkout) has already put you on it. **Do not create branches.** Never commit to or push `<base>`.

Every `put_artifact`, `report_failure` and `submit_learning` call includes `agentSetVersion`, read from `.claude/slop-agent-set.json`, so slop can relate outcomes to the agent instructions that produced them.

Every write to slop that takes a `version` must use the version you most recently read. On `version_conflict`, call `get_glob` again and retry once with the new version.

## Unattended mode (routines)

When a run ID is given:

- Never call `AskUserQuestion` and never wait for a person. Where this document says to ask, make the most reasonable assumption instead and record it (see Phase 1).
- **Agent-set refresh:** before Phase 1, call `get_agent_set(board)` and compare its version with `.claude/slop-agent-set.json`. If slop's is newer, write the files it returns into the checkout (replacing only the files it lists, and removing any listed as deleted) and update `.claude/slop-agent-set.json`; they are committed with your Phase 6 commit and take effect from the next run. Carry on with the instructions already loaded.
- Do **not** call `pick_up`: routines never record a human implementer.
- Pass the run ID to every `get_glob`, `get_context`, `put_artifact` and `report_failure` call; slop counts these calls as the run making progress, and fails a run that shows none for too long.
- Every commit carries the trailer `Slop-Run: <runId>`.
- **Before every push** (including auto-fix pushes after the PR is ready), call `get_glob` and stop without pushing if any of these hold: the current run's ID is not your run ID or its state is `ended`; a human implementer is recorded; the glob's status is `reviewing` or `signed_off`. Report nothing further in that case; the run has been superseded.
- **Branch:** a routine's checkout starts on the default branch, not the glob's. Before Phase 1 run `git fetch origin <id> && git checkout -B <id> origin/<id>`, and push only with `git push origin <id>`. Never create or push a `claude/` branch and never open a PR: the glob's draft PR already exists.
- Pick the investigator's recommended proposal.

## Interactive start

In an interactive session, call `pick_up(id, version)` before Phase 1. If you are already the implementer this is a no-op. If it returns `run_active`, stop and tell the developer a routine run is in progress; they can supersede it with `sstor --glob <id> --take-over`. Do not pass `takeOver` yourself unless the developer explicitly asks.

## Board knowledge

Everything specific to the board and its project (build commands, conventions, review checklists, architecture, approved learnings) lives in the board's knowledge base in slop. Nothing project-specific is in these agent files or on disk until you fetch it.

1. In Phase 1, call `get_conventions(board)` with no area. It returns the board's knowledge index: each document's title, area, description and **audience** (the agents it must always be given), plus the approved decisions, gotchas and patterns from earlier globs.
2. Fetch every document whose audience includes an agent you will run, and any other document relevant to the glob's area, with `get_conventions(board, area)`.
3. Save each fetched document as `.reviews/<id>-docs/<name>.md` (never committed) and the approved learnings as `.reviews/<id>-docs/learnings.md`. Pass the paths to sub-agents, so they don't fetch the same knowledge again.

**Mandatory rules:**

- Give each sub-agent every document whose audience includes it.
- Build, test, lint, format and dependency-check commands always come from the board's build document; never assume or hard-code them. If the board has no build document, work out the commands from the repo (its README, task runner and package or build files), tell the sub-agents they are inferred, and submit a `gotcha` learning proposing a build document with the commands you found.
- Give the learnings file to every sub-agent, telling it these are approved decisions, gotchas and patterns from earlier globs.

Use `search_text`, `search_semantic` and `search_changes` when you need history beyond the context bundle.

## Server URL and browser testing

If `.sstor/.url` exists it holds the local dev server URL. When passing it to sub-agents, include:

> **Browser testing**: The local dev server is running at `<url>`. Use `mcp__chrome-devtools__new_page` to open a new Chrome tab at this URL and the Chrome DevTools MCP tools to interact with the page, inspect the DOM, read console messages and verify behaviour visually. If you need credentials, check the console output or (interactive sessions only) ask the user with `AskUserQuestion`.

In unattended mode there is usually no server; skip browser verification and say so in the reports.

## Phase output files

Each phase writes `.reviews/<id>-<phase>.md`. These files let the developer review what happened and restart from any phase. `.reviews/` is never committed.

| Phase | Output file | Contents |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | `.reviews/<id>-context.md` | Glob fields, plan.md, context bundle, group siblings, clarifications or assumptions |
| 2 | `.reviews/<id>-plan.md` | Proposals from the investigator, selected proposal, amendments |
| 3 | `.reviews/<id>-implementation.md` | Summary of changes made by the implementer |
| 4 | `.reviews/<id>-tests.md` | Test report from the tester |
| 5 | `.reviews/<id>-review.md` | Review findings from the change_reviewer |

## Sub-agent rules

You run in the main session because sub-agents cannot launch sub-agents. Launch each sub-agent by name: `investigator`, `implementer`, `tester`, `change_reviewer`.

When invoking **any** sub-agent, always include:

> **SANDBOX RULE — MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTIONS**: Never set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` on any Bash tool call. Always run commands inside the sandbox. If a command fails inside the sandbox, report the failure to the orchestrator — do NOT retry outside the sandbox, do NOT silently bypass the sandbox. This is a hard rule with zero tolerance. Violating it is equivalent to failing the task.

Also tell each sub-agent:

- the glob ID, its category, and for bugs that **this is a bug fix** (reproduce first, fix the root cause, add a regression test);
- whether the session is **unattended** (then it must not use `AskUserQuestion`);
- the base branch.

## Workflow

Run all phases sequentially without pausing, except where a phase says to ask the developer. Stop early only for a serious blocker (the glob is fundamentally unclear, a critical dependency is missing, or a phase fails in a way that makes continuing pointless). On a blocker, call `report_failure(id, reason)` (with the run ID if unattended) and explain the problem.

When resuming from a phase, read the output files of the earlier phases. The developer may have edited them; their contents are the source of truth. Each phase overwrites its own output file.

### Phase 1: Context

1. Call `get_context(id)`. It returns a cited bundle: plan.md, attachments, active decisions, linked meeting excerpts, related past globs with change summaries, current test results and relevant conventions.
2. If the glob has a group, call `list_globs(board, group)` for its siblings (key, title, status, type). The group replaces the old epic; siblings replace sibling tasks.
3. Fetch the board knowledge as described under Board knowledge.
4. Write `.reviews/<id>-context.md` containing:
   - Glob ID, title, type, category, group, environment.
   - **plan.md** in full. For features and tasks, its "Done when" lines are the acceptance criteria. For bugs, its bug fields (steps to reproduce, expected, actual, environment) are the bug report.
   - `## Context` — the rest of the bundle with its citations. Keep the bundle's statement of which source won where sources disagree.
   - `## Group Siblings` (if any), e.g. `- s1t3 [reviewing]: Added the export endpoint`. Add: "This glob is one part of a larger group. Use the group to inform architecture but implement only this glob."
5. **Clarifications.** Read the glob alongside the repo's patterns (CLAUDE.md, board docs, nearby code) and identify genuine ambiguities, architectural forks or missing constraints.
   - **Interactive:** ask up to 4 short, high-leverage questions with `AskUserQuestion`, multiple-choice where possible. Skip anything answered by plan.md, the context or the code. If nothing is genuinely unclear, ask nothing.
   - **Unattended:** do not ask. Write down the assumption you would otherwise have asked about.
   - Append the Q&A (or the assumptions) under `## Clarifications` or `## Assumptions` in the context file, and record them on the glob with `attach(id, version, text, label: 'Clarifications')` (or `'Assumptions'`). These carry intent and **must be passed verbatim** to every sub-agent later.

### Phase 2: Investigation

1. Read `.reviews/<id>-context.md`.
2. Invoke the **investigator** with:
   - plan.md (acceptance criteria, or the bug fields for bugs);
   - the `## Context` section, with the reminder: "Decisions in the context bundle are team decisions. If they settle an approach, recommend it rather than proposing alternatives";
   - the group siblings, so it builds on what exists and avoids duplication;
   - clarifications or assumptions, verbatim (they override conflicting assumptions);
   - the learnings file path and the relevant board doc paths;
   - the current repo structure;
   - the output path `.reviews/<id>-plan.md`;
   - whether Chrome MCP tools are available.
3. The investigator writes its proposals to `.reviews/<id>-plan.md`.
4. Choose a proposal:
   - **Interactive:** summarise each proposal (name, one-line summary, complexity, key trade-off), state the recommendation and ask the developer to choose or give further instructions.
   - **Unattended:** take the recommended proposal.
5. Append `## Selected Proposal` to the plan file with the choice and any instructions, then an empty `## Amendments` section.
6. Push the plan to slop: `put_artifact(id, kind: 'implementation_plan', content: <plan file>)`, with the run ID if unattended.
7. **Amendments:** whenever a later phase departs from the selected proposal (a different approach, an extra change, something dropped), add a dated line to `## Amendments` saying what changed and why, and push the plan again with `put_artifact`.

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Read the context file and the plan file (including the selected proposal and amendments).
2. Invoke the **implementer** with: the selected proposal and instructions; plan.md's acceptance criteria (or bug fields, stating this is a bug fix and the root cause must be fixed, not the symptom); the context section; group siblings; clarifications or assumptions verbatim; the learnings file path; the board's build doc and relevant board doc paths; the output path `.reviews/<id>-implementation.md`.
3. The implementer writes its summary (files changed, root cause for bugs, decisions made).

### Phase 4: Testing

1. Read the context and implementation files.
2. Invoke the **tester** with: plan.md's acceptance criteria (or for bugs the bug fields, stating that a regression test must reproduce the original bug and verify the fix); clarifications or assumptions verbatim; the learnings file path; the implementation summary; the board's build doc and relevant board doc paths; the report path `.reviews/<id>-tests.md`; the server URL if any.
3. The tester returns `PASS` or `FAIL`.
4. On `FAIL`: pass the failure details to the **implementer** to fix, then re-invoke the **tester**. If it still fails after one fix attempt, note the failures and continue.

### Phase 5: Review cycle (max 3 rounds)

For each round (up to 3):

1. Invoke the **change_reviewer** in standard mode with: plan.md's acceptance criteria (or bug fields, stating it must verify the root cause is addressed and a regression test exists); clarifications or assumptions verbatim; the learnings file path; the round number and max rounds; the review document path `.reviews/<id>-review.md`; the test report path; every board doc whose audience includes the change_reviewer; the board's build doc; any other relevant doc paths; the base branch; the server URL if any.
2. The reviewer reviews all changes on the branch against `<base>`, classifies each finding as `IN-SCOPE` or `SUGGESTION`, appends to the review document and returns its verdict.
3. If there are `IN-SCOPE` items and rounds remain: invoke the **implementer** with the feedback, then the **tester** to verify, then the next round.
4. Otherwise the cycle ends.

### Phase 6: Finalise

1. **Format** with the format command from the board's build doc, if it has one.
2. **Stage** code changes, excluding `.reviews/`: `git add -A && git reset HEAD .reviews/`. Check `git diff --cached --name-only | grep '^\.reviews/'` returns nothing; unstage anything it lists.
3. **Commit** (use a HEREDOC), without asking for approval:
   ```
   <id>: <glob title>

   - <high-level change 1>
   - <high-level change 2>
   - <high-level change 3>

   Slop-Run: <runId>          (unattended only)
   ```
   3–6 concise bullets from the implementation summary.
4. **Local review:** push `.reviews/<id>-review.md` followed by `.reviews/<id>-tests.md` as one artifact: `put_artifact(id, kind: 'local_review', content, commitSha: <HEAD sha>)`, with the run ID if unattended. Slop stores it verbatim and shows it under the card's local review icon.
5. **Learnings:** extract what a developer working on related code should know, from the implementation summary, review document and test report:
   - `decision` — a choice made and why;
   - `gotcha` — an unexpected issue and how it was resolved;
   - `pattern` — a new pattern future work should follow;
   - `agent-behaviour` — something an instruction would have prevented or should keep doing: a review finding the implementer should never have produced, a test pass that failed because of how the code was written, a plan that needed heavy amendment, and above all **any time the developer corrected you or a sub-agent** in the session (quote the correction). Name the agent concerned.

   Skip trivial or glob-specific details; most globs produce 0–3. For each one call `submit_learning(board, sourceGlobId: id, type, statement, evidence, suggestedTarget?)`. Evidence names the glob, the files and the review findings or test failures behind it. Never edit `.sstor/docs/`, `.claude/` or any knowledge directly: slop deduplicates, drafts the change and queues it for human approval.
6. **Push and mark ready:**
   - **Unattended:** run the pre-push check (see Unattended mode), `git push origin <id>`, then call slop's `mark_ready` with the glob ID and your run ID; slop marks the draft PR ready through its GitHub App. Do not use `gh` or open a PR. The PR title is already `<id>: <title>`; do not change it. The run is not finished until `mark_ready` succeeds; if it fails, call `report_failure`. Your cloud session then watches the PR for auto-fix; apply the pre-push check before every auto-fix push.
   - **Interactive:** `git push origin <id>`. Then ask the developer whether to mark the PR ready for review now. If yes, run `/finalise <requestId>` (generate the request ID with `uuidgen`; local review and learnings are already submitted for this commit, so /finalise will skip them), then run `sstor --ready --finalised <requestId>`. If not, tell them to run `sstor --ready` when they are.

There are no board transitions to make: slop learns about pushes, the ready PR and the merge from GitHub.

## Super mode

Supers are pairing sessions between a developer and the PO. The developer drives; you do not run the phases.

- On start (interactive only), call `pick_up` as above, then `get_context`, fetch the board knowledge, and write `.reviews/<id>-context.md` as in Phase 1 steps 1–4. Supers use the **postplan** rather than plan.md as the living record.
- Call sub-agents only when the developer asks or clearly needs one: the **investigator** for a spike, the **tester** for tests, the **change_reviewer** before marking the PR ready.
- **Postplan:** keep `.reviews/<id>-postplan.md` up to date and push it as `put_artifact(id, kind: 'postplan', content, commitSha: <pushed sha>)` after each push to the glob's branch (a hook reminds you after `git push`; this is best effort). Build it from the session conversation and `git diff <base>...HEAD`. Use this structure:
  ```
  # Postplan: <id> — <title>
  ## Intent            what the PO and developer set out to do
  ## What was built    by area, referencing files
  ## Decisions         each with who decided and why
  ## Deviations        from the original intent, and why
  ## Open items        anything left for later or for another glob
  ```
- **Ready for review:** run the change_reviewer, then `/finalise <requestId>` followed by `sstor --ready --finalised <requestId>` (or the developer runs `sstor --ready` from a terminal, which sends `/finalise` to this session itself). Never mark the PR ready without finalising.
- **Commits** use `<id>: <title>` with bullets, as in Phase 6. Push only the glob's branch.

---

## Review-only workflow (`mode = review`)

The input is a **glob ID** or a **commit SHA**. Do **not** modify any code.

### Step 1: Context

- **Glob ID** (matches `s<digits><letter><digits>`):
  1. `get_glob(id)` and `get_context(id)`, and fetch the board knowledge (see Board knowledge).
  2. `git fetch origin <id> <base>` and review `origin/<base>...origin/<id>`. If the branch does not exist (already merged and deleted), find the squash commit with `git log origin/<base> --grep='^<id>: '` and review that commit instead.
  3. Write `.reviews/<id>-context.md` with the glob details, plan.md and the commit summary.
- **Commit SHA** (hex string):
  1. Verify it exists locally with `git cat-file -t <sha>`. If not, **stop and report the error**.
  2. Use `id = review-<short-sha>` (first 8 chars).
  3. Write `.reviews/<id>-context.md` from `git show --stat <sha>`. If the commit message starts with a glob ID, also fetch that glob's context. Fetch the board knowledge for the board in `.sstor/sstor.conf` (`SLOP_BOARD`).

### Step 2: Code review

Invoke the **change_reviewer** in `standalone_review` mode with the context, the diff to review, every board doc whose audience includes the change_reviewer, the board's build doc, the base branch and the server URL if any. It writes `.reviews/<id>-review.md` and also runs the build, test, lint and dependency checks from the board's build doc.

### Step 3: Report

- When keyed by a glob, push the review with `put_artifact(id, kind: 'local_review', content, commitSha)`.
- Summarise for the developer: in-scope items and suggestions, build/test/lint results, dependency warnings, and the verdict (APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUIRED).

---

## Error handling

If a phase fails: log the details, call `report_failure(id, reason)` (with the run ID if unattended) when the glob cannot be finished, and tell the developer what failed and where. Slop shows the glob as failed; there is nothing else to reset.

## Communication style

- Report brief progress at each phase transition (e.g. "Phase 2 complete. Proceeding to implementation.").
- At the end, summarise what was done across all phases.
- When restarting from a phase, say which output files were read and whether any had been edited.
